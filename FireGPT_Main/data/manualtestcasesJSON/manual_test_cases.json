        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC_001_GroundFaultDetection\n\n**Test Objective:** To verify that the XDLC (XNET Digital Loop Controller) detects ground faults correctly and communicates them to the PMI properly.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n1. The system under test (SUT) is connected correctly with all components functional.\n2. Ground fault detection is enabled at a NIM-1R located in a cabinet with either an MMB-1/-2, SMB-1/-2, or PSR-1.\n3. The XNET is divided into multiple sections of copper wire using fiber optic segments for this test.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Initialize the XDLC and ensure it starts operating without any ground fault errors.\n   - Verify that DLCFault bits B7 (Ground Fault plus) and B6 (Ground Fault minus) are reset (0).\n   - Verify that DLC is running without degrade mode (B3 = 0, P2UART Failure; B2 = 0, P2 Core Failure).\n\n2. Introduce a ground fault on the Loop minus side conductor.\n   - Connect one end of a jumper wire between Loop minus and Ground terminals at a point other than the NIM-1R.\n   - Ensure that this connection does not cause any physical damage or short circuit.\n\n3. Monitor the XDLC's DLCFault bits after introducing the ground fault:\n   - Verify that B6 (Ground Fault minus) is set (1).\n   - Verify that other bits remain unaffected, i.e., B7 remains reset (0), and no degrade mode flags are set (B2 & B3 remain 0).\n\n4. Check the PMI display to ensure it shows the ground fault information correctly:\n   - Navigate to the troubleshooting/alarms screen.\n   - Verify that the ground fault on Loop minus is displayed with relevant details.\n\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 for a ground fault on the Loop plus side conductor, verifying that B7 (Ground Fault plus) is set appropriately.\n\n6. Remove all ground faults and verify that DLCFault bits return to their reset states:\n   - Disconnect the jumper wires used in steps 2 and 5.\n   - Verify that both B7 and B6 are reset (0).\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- Ground fault detection should trigger as expected on both Loop plus and minus sides with the relevant DLCFault bits set appropriately.\n- The PMI should display ground fault information correctly upon receiving it from the XDLC.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n- All steps must be completed without any system errors or failures.\n- DLCFault bits B7 and B6 must reflect ground faults accurately (set to 1 when fault is present, reset to 0 when fault is removed).\n- PMI display should correctly show ground fault information once it's received from the XDLC.\n\nSources: NCCNT-Gr4part1.pdf, XDLC_installation.pdf, HnetProtocolforP2Linecards 3.pdf"

        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC_ZIC_001\n\n**Test Objective:** To verify the functionality of Ground Fault Detection (GFD) feature on ZIC-4A card.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n1. The system has been installed and powered up.\n2. At least one ZIC-4A card with ground fault detection enabled is present in the system.\n3. No physical ground faults are present during testing to avoid false positives.\n4. Ground Fault Detection Control (S1) switch on the tested ZIC-4A card is set to the 'Disable' position initially.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Set Ground Fault Detection Control (S1) switch to the 'Enable' position.\n2. Connect a known good power source with appropriate ground reference to the zone inputs of the tested ZIC-4A card.\n3. Verify that the diagnostic LED for GFD is OFF, indicating no ground fault detected.\n4. Introduce a temporary artificial ground fault on one of the zone output circuits by connecting its output terminals together temporarily using a thin wire or jumper.\n5. Observe the diagnostic LED for GFD. It should turn ON, indicating a ground fault has been detected.\n6. Remove the artificial ground fault by disconnecting the jumper.\n7. Verify that the diagnostic LED for GFD turns OFF again, indicating no ground fault is present.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n1. Ground Fault Detection Control (S1) switch sets GFD functionality accordingly ('Enable' or 'Disable').\n2. In the absence of a ground fault, the GFD diagnostic LED remains OFF.\n3. When a ground fault is introduced on one of the zone output circuits, the GFD diagnostic LED turns ON.\n4. After removing the artificial ground fault, the GFD diagnostic LED turns OFF.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n1. All steps execute without errors or warnings.\n2. Ground Fault Detection Control (S1) switch functions correctly and sets GFD functionality accordingly.\n3. Diagnostic LED for GFD accurately reflects the presence or absence of a ground fault on the zone output circuits.\n\n**Additional Information:** Perform these tests with multiple ZIC-4A cards to ensure consistent results, remembering that only one card should have GFD enabled at a time to avoid false positives when reporting troubles.\n\nSources: A6V10239104_en.pdf, A6V10239113_en.pdf, ZIC4A.pdf, ZIC-4Ar4.pdf"

        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC_RPM_Minimize\n\n**Test Objective:** To verify that the Remote Printer Module (RPM) can be minimized from the user interface, and its functionality is preserved when restored.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n1. The system is powered on and running.\n2. The RPM module is connected to the HNET network and has power limited output.\n3. A Centronics parallel printer is connected to the RPM and functioning correctly.\n4. The user is logged in with appropriate privileges to minimize/maximize windows.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Access the Main Screen of the User Interface.\n2. Locate the RPM module's window (assuming it has been opened previously).\n3. Click on the minimize button (usually located at the top-right corner of the window) to minimize the RPM module window.\n4. Verify that the RPM module window is no longer visible in the main screen.\n5. Open the Task Manager or equivalent task switching utility to confirm that the RPM module process is still running.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. The RPM module window should be minimized, and its title bar should appear at the bottom of the screen among other minimized windows.\n2. The RPM module's functionality, such as translating HNET messages and printing logs, should continue uninterrupted even when minimized.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n1. Pass if the RPM module window can be successfully minimized without any errors or warnings.\n2. Pass if the RPM module process is still running in the background after minimizing its window.\n3. Fail if the RPM module window cannot be minimized or if it disappears completely from the system (i.e., the process is terminated).\n4. Fail if there are any unexpected behaviors, errors, or warnings during the minimize operation.\n\n**Additional Test Steps for Positive Confirmation:**\n\n1. Restore the minimized RPM module window by clicking on its title bar at the bottom of the screen.\n2. Verify that the restored window retains all its functionality as it was before minimizing.\n3. Repeat steps 1 to 4 above, minimizing and restoring the RPM module window multiple times to ensure consistent behavior.\n\nSources: Getting Started with Zeus.pdf, Zeus Quick-Start Manual.pdf, A6V10239430_en.pdf, A6V10433251_en.pdf"

The FireFinder-XLS system is fully functional and operational.\n2. Addressable smoke detectors are connected to DLCs/HZMs, with at least one detector not having an integral alarm verification feature.\n3. The Retard-Reset Period is programmed in the Zeus tool.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Initiate an alarm condition on a detector without integral alarm verification.\n2. Observe that the control panel receives an alert indicating that the device has entered verification but is not yet considered to be in alarm.\n3. Allow the Retard-Reset Period (programmed in the Zeus tool) to elapse and monitor the system.\n4. Observe that after the timer expires, the DLC begins a fixed 60-second confirmation period.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. The control panel displays an alert indicating verification has started but the alarm is not yet confirmed.\n2. After the Retard-Reset Period, the device enters the fixed 60-second confirmation period.\n3. If the detector returns to normal during this period, the verification cycle should be aborted, and no alarm should be generated.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n1. The control panel correctly receives alerts about verification status changes.\n2. The system accurately enforces the Retard-Reset Period and initiates the 60-second confirmation period.\n3. If the detector returns to normal during the confirmation period, no false alarm is triggered; otherwise, the system generates an alarm as expected.\n\n**Test Case ID:** TC_XLS_ALARM_VERIFICATION_002\n\n**Test Objective:** Verify that detectors with integral alarm verification are ignored by FireFinder-XLS's alarm verification feature.\n\n**Preconditions:**\nSame as TC_XLS_ALARM_VERIFICATION_001, but with at least one detector having an integral alarm verification feature.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Initiate an alarm condition on a detector with integral alarm verification.\n2. Observe the system response during and after the Retard-Reset Period.\n\n**Expected Results:**\nThe FireFinder-XLS system should ignore detectors with integral alarm verification, treating them as if they have entered alarm without requiring confirmation.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n1. The control panel does not receive verification status alerts for detectors with integral alarm verification.\n2. Upon detecting an alarm condition on a detector with integral verification, the system immediately treats it as an alarm without initiating the verification cycle.\n\nSources: A6V10433251_en.pdf, A6V10322963_en.pdf, XLS-IOMmanualR3.pdf"
