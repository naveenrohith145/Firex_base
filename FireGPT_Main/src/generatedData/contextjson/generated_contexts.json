Important Constraints or Assumptions:**\n\n   - **Dependencies:** The functionality of XDLC's alarm generation is dependent on stable real-time data collection and reliable notification services.\n   - **Edge Cases:** Some edge cases may not be testable due to practical limitations (e.g., ensuring no alarms are triggered for hours/days).\n   - **Test Data:** Use varied but realistic parameter values and threshold settings during testing.\n\n**Manual Test Cases:**\n\n1. Verify alarm generation with varying parameter thresholds.\n2. Verify alarm latency under different data collection rates.\n3. Validate notification delivery to users via email and SMS.\n4. Check alarm history logs for accuracy and completeness.\n5. Test system behavior under high load conditions (e.g., many simultaneous alarms).\n6. Ensure no false positives/negatives when parameter values fluctuate around thresholds.\n7. Verify edge cases where multiple thresholds are breached simultaneously.\n8. Validate system functionality during periods of no active alarms.\n9. Check alarm history logs for accuracy and completeness after long periods without alarms.\n10. Test edge case scenarios with varying threshold differences (just below, exactly at, just above)."
