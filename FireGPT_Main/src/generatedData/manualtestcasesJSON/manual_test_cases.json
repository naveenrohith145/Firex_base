        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC_ZIC4A_HR001\n\n**Test Objective:** To verify the behavior of the ZIC-4A module after a hard reset.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n1. The ZIC-4A module is installed in a CC-5 cardcage.\n2. Power is applied to the module.\n3. No faults or alarms are present on the module.\n4. The module is in its default state (NORMAL mode).\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Verify that all LEDs except POWER and CARD FAIL are OFF.\n2. Push and hold the reset switch for more than 5 seconds to perform a hard reset.\n3. Release the reset switch after 5 seconds.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. After releasing the reset switch, observe the following:\n   - POWER LED remains ON, indicating that power is still applied to the card.\n   - CARD FAIL LED remains OFF, indicating no microprocessor failure.\n   - Other LEDs (CAN FAIL, ACK 1-6, ACK SECURITY 1-10, ACK SUPERVISORY 1-9, ACK TROUBLE 1-10) remain OFF as there are no faults or alarms present.\n2. The module re-initializes its operation and returns to the NORMAL mode.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\nThis test case will pass if:\n- All LEDs behave as expected after the hard reset (as mentioned in Expected Results).\n- The module successfully re-initializes its operation and returns to the NORMAL mode.\n- No unexpected behavior or errors are observed during or after the hard reset process.\n\nSources: PMIManualr2.pdf, XLS-IOMmanualR3.pdf, ZIC4A.pdf, A6V10239104_en.pdf, ZIC-4Ar4.pdf"

        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC001\n\n**Test Objective:** Verify the behavior of the ZIC-4A module after a hard reset and ensure it boots up within 30 seconds with all hardware components functioning normally.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n1. The ZIC-4A module is powered on and operational.\n2. All connected hardware components are functioning normally.\n3. The module has user settings and data stored in its flash memory.\n4. No critical operations (e.g., data transmission) are in progress during the hard reset.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Initiate a hard reset by pressing and holding the reset button on the ZIC-4A module for 5 seconds.\n2. Observe the module's behavior during the reset process. Verify that all LEDs, displays, or indicators show the expected status changes.\n3. Record the time when the hard reset is initiated.\n4. Wait for up to 30 seconds for the module to reboot completely.\n5. Once the module boots up, verify its functionality by performing the following checks:\n   a. Check if the module responds to commands via CAN bus and Ethernet.\n   b. Verify that all connected hardware components are functioning normally (e.g., sensors reading data correctly, actuators responding to control signals).\n   c. Confirm that user settings and data stored in flash memory remain intact after the hard reset.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n1. The module should enter the reset process as indicated by changes in LED or display status.\n2. The module should reboot within 30 seconds after initiating the hard reset.\n3. All hardware components connected to the ZIC-4A module should function normally post-hard reset.\n4. User settings and data stored in flash memory should remain unchanged.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n1. If the module boots up within 30 seconds with all hardware components functioning normally, and user settings/data are intact, then the test case passes.\n2. If the module fails to reboot within 30 seconds or any of the connected hardware components fail to function normally post-hard reset, then the test case fails.\n\n**Additional Remarks:**\n- Retest this scenario multiple times to ensure the consistency of the module's behavior after a hard reset.\n- Monitor the system logs and performance metrics during and after the hard reset process for any anomalies or degradation in performance.\n\nSources: PMIManualr2.pdf, XLS-IOMmanualR3.pdf, ZIC4A.pdf, A6V10239104_en.pdf, ZIC-4Ar4.pdf"

Trigger an alarm condition on one of the addressable detectors connected to a DLC.\n2. Observe that the DLC alerts the control panel about entering verification but is not yet in alarm.\n3. Wait for the duration of the verification cycle (as per system specifications).\n4. Check if the detector's status changes from 'Verification' to 'Alarm' during the confirmation period.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. The control panel should display the addressable detector's status as 'Verification' immediately after triggering the alarm condition.\n2. After the verification cycle, if the detector remains in alarm, its status should change to 'Alarm'.\n3. If the detector returns to a non-alarm state during the confirmation period, the verification cycle should be considered incomplete.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n- If the detector's status changes from 'Verification' to 'Alarm' after the verification cycle, the test case passes.\n- If the detector returns to a non-alarm state and the verification cycle is considered incomplete, the test case passes.\n- If there are any deviations or inconsistencies in the above scenarios, the test case fails.\n\nSources: A6V10433251_en.pdf, A6V10322963_en.pdf, XLS-IOMmanualR3.pdf"

        "manual_test_case": "**Test Case ID:** TC_XDLC_ALARM_001\n\n**Test Objective:** Verify alarm generation with varying parameter thresholds.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- The XDLC system is up and running, collecting real-time data via Modbus protocol.\n- Alarm Configuration table contains varied threshold values for multiple parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure).\n- Email and SMS gateway services are configured and functional.\n- Monitoring tools are set up to track alarm generation latency.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Access the XDLC web interface and navigate to the 'Alarm Configuration' page.\n2. Note down the current threshold values for various parameters.\n3. Manually adjust one parameter's threshold value, setting it slightly higher or lower than its current value (e.g., change temperature threshold from 50\u00b0C to 49.5\u00b0C).\n4. Save the changes and observe the system for any immediate alarms or notifications.\n5. Monitor real-time data collection and wait for the parameter value to breach the new threshold naturally (i.e., without artificial manipulation).\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. No immediate alarms or notifications should occur upon saving the threshold change.\n2. Once the parameter value breaches the new threshold, an alarm should be generated within the specified latency (\u22645 seconds).\n3. An email and SMS notification should be sent to the configured recipients.\n4. The 'Alarm History' table should update with the new alarm entry, including timestamp, parameter, value, and status ('Active' or 'Resolved').\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n- If an alarm is generated within the specified latency upon threshold breach, and both email and SMS notifications are delivered successfully, then the test case passes.\n- If any of these expected results do not occur (e.g., no alarm generation, notifications not delivered), then the test case fails.\n\n---\n\n**Test Case ID:** TC_XDLC_ALARM_002\n\n**Test Objective:** Verify alarm latency under different data collection rates.\n\n**Preconditions:**\n- Same as TC_XDLC_ALARM_001.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n1. Access the XDLC web interface and navigate to the 'System Configuration' page.\n2. Note down the current data collection rate (e.g., every 5 seconds).\n3. Manually adjust the data collection rate, setting it to either its maximum (every second) or minimum (once every hour) value.\n4. Save the changes and wait for a sufficient duration to observe multiple alarm generations at the new rate.\n5. Monitor system performance using tracking tools during this period.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n\n1. The adjusted data collection rate should take effect immediately upon saving the change.\n2. Alarm generation latency should not exceed 5 seconds, regardless of the data collection rate.\n3. System availability should remain high (>99.9%) under both maximum and minimum data collection rates.\n\n**Pass/Fail Criteria:**\n\n- If alarm generation latency remains \u22645 seconds under both maximum and minimum data collection rates, and system availability stays high, then the test case passes.\n- If alarm generation latency exceeds 5 seconds or system availability drops below 99.9% under either rate, then the test case fails.\n\n---\n\n*Continue creating comprehensive manual test cases for other scenarios like validating notification delivery, checking alarm history logs, testing high load conditions, and edge cases as requested.*\n\nSources: Zeus 3.0 Quick-Start Manual.pdf, A6V10433251_en.pdf, Zeus 9.0 Quick-Start ManualR18draft_04-26-13_GLC.pdf, A6V10322963_en.pdf"
