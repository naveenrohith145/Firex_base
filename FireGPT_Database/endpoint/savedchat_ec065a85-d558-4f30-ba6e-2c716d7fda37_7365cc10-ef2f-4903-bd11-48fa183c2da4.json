    "response": "This image appears to be a template for a hospital emergency contact card. It has three sections, each with a rounded rectangular border and black text on a red background.\n\nThe first section contains the following information:\n\n* Hospital 1\n* Contact No.\n* Distance from your location\n\nThe second section is identical to the first, except that it refers to \"Hospital 2\" instead of \"Hospital 1\".\n\nThe third section has only two lines of text: \"Image of hospital\" and another line with the same text. This suggests that the user should insert a photo or image of the hospital here.\n\nOverall, this template seems designed to help individuals quickly access important contact information for nearby hospitals in case of an emergency.\n\nAdditional image context: The image presents a red background with black text boxes, each containing specific information about hospitals.\n\n*   **Hospital 1 Contact No. Distance from your location**\n    *   The first box is located at the top left of the image and contains two lines of text.\n    *   The first line reads \"Hospital 1\" followed by \"Contact No.\" on a new line, indicating that this section provides contact information for Hospital 1.\n    *   The second line states \"Distance from your location\", suggesting that it may provide details about how far the hospital is located from the viewer's current position or another specified location.\n*   **Hospital 2 Contact No. Distance from your location**\n    *   Below the first box, a similar structure appears for Hospital 2.\n    *   The text reads \"Hospital 2\" followed by \"Contact No.\" on a new line, providing contact details for Hospital 2.\n    *   The next line repeats the phrase \"Distance from your location\", implying that it also offers information about the distance of Hospital 2 from the viewer's current or specified location.\n*   **Image of hospital**\n    *   Two additional boxes are placed at the bottom of the image, labeled \"Image of hospital\" without any further details.\n    *   These sections likely contain visual representations or images related to the hospitals mentioned earlier.\n\nIn summary, the image displays three groups of text boxes on a red background. Each group contains information about a specific hospital, including contact numbers and distances from the viewer's location. Additionally, there are two unlabeled \"Image of hospital\" sections that may hold visual content related to these institutions.\n\nNote: Please refer to the original documents for verification.",
